# atm_machine
This project simulates atm transactions for deposit and widthdrawl actions at an atm machine.  The Account balance represents your bank account total.  If the user tries to get more cash back than available, the 'Submit' button is disabled.

This project demonstrates the following concepts: 
- use of React state
- use of hierarchical web components


I had fun learning how to use React to simulate an atm application.

### How to Run
Anyone can run this file by downloading the repository, running a local file server like node http-server


### Future Improvements
Add different styling to the atm buttons and clearing out the transaction amount after pressing 'Submit'.
